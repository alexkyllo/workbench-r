I fitted a linear model. It isn't a very good model, but that's not the point.

Scatter plot!

![Scatter plot](../figures/scatter_plot.png)

Here is a summary of the model features (there's only one):

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

model <- readRDS(here("models/model.Rds"))

suppressMessages(library(broom))

tidy(model)

```
